# Outcome

This implementation was a failure. Because certain keyboard shortcuts were hot-keyed, this made the log in setting buggy. In addition, it isn't a very friendly UI and makes it actually harder to see the maps, the whole point of the prototype.

# Feature

The goal of this prototype (and the others) is to explore various ways we can implement a user feed, where people logged in can see their posts along with the people they follow's posts.

# This implementation

This implementation was based off the terminal, using keyboard shortcuts and commands to expand a text-based list of the prototypes and maps

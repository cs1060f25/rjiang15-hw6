# Outcome

This implementation was a failure. Because this implementation was supposed to only have one image viewed at a time and then switch between buttons, it would lag and not render the images on startup, and the buttons were clunky and unintuitive. In addition, it prevents the curious scrolling that other feed iterfaces allow.

# Feature

The goal of this prototype (and the others) is to explore various ways we can implement a user feed, where people logged in can see their posts along with the people they follow's posts.

# This implementation

This implementation was based off of simulating a touchscreen without swiping. The idea was to focus on accessibility, with large buttons and only a mouse needed instead of any keyboard commands.

# Outcome

This implementation was a success, found here: https://rjiang15-hw6.onrender.com. Likes are visible and accurate, and we have the ability to see other people's posts accurately.

# Feature

The goal of this prototype (and the others) is to explore various ways we can implement a user feed, where people logged in can see their posts along with the people they follow's posts.

# This implementation

This implementation was based off of Instagram's style of scrolling downward and organizing posts based on who you are allowed to see. Each post has its own part of the screen along with vertical scrolling, and likes are attached to the post themselves.
